            In my final year academic project, "Automaton Assistant," I designed
            a robot controlled via Blynk switches. It reads RFID tags using an
            RM18 reader, announcing and displaying corresponding lab names on a
            16x2 LCD upon detection. Additionally, the robot incorporates an
            ultrasonic sensor to halt for obstacle detection during inter-lab
            movement. In my third-year academic project, I developed an
            IoT-based health monitoring system using Arduino.

          <h4>
            Beyond academics, I completed a 1-month internship in Embedded
            Systems, participated in the Unisys Student Innovation Program,
            where I developed a project for attended monitoring using face
            recognition. I've attended workshops at NIT colleges and
            AI4Students, showcasing my commitment to continuous learning.
            Serving as the President of the IEI Students Chapters reflects my
            leadership skills and active involvement in extracurricular
            activities.
